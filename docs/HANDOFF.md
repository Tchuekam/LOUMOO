# Handoff log — delivery tracking

Read this and `docs/DELIVERY_API.md` before starting any step. Append a short
entry after finishing one. Newest entry first.

## Working rules (Claude + ChatGPT/Codex)
1. **Separate branch and folder each.** Backend: `feat/delivery-backend`
   (`../LOUMOO APP.worktrees/delivery-backend`). Frontend: `feat/delivery-frontend`
   (`../LOUMOO APP.worktrees/delivery-frontend`). Never edit the other's folder
   and never work directly on `main`.
2. **File ownership.**
   - Backend: `server/modules/delivery/**`, `server/infrastructure/database/migrations/013_*.sql`,
     backend tests, the one-line route mount in `server/index.js`.
   - Frontend: `src/views/**`, `src/styles/**`, `src/services/**`.
   - Generated, never hand-edited: `Commerce App.dc.html`, `*.dc.html`. Rebuild with
     `npm run build:frontend`, only after merging, one side at a time.
   - Shared and risky (`build_redesign.py`, `package.json`, `server/index.js`):
     touch only when the other side has no unmerged work in it, and say so here.
3. **Contract first.** API changes go into `docs/DELIVERY_API.md` before code.
4. **Only the owner merges to `main`**, by pull request, after `npm test` passes.
5. **Small steps, pull `main` before each one.** Commit often.
6. **Secrets never go in chat or in git.** Keys belong in `.env.local`.

## Plan
| Step | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Branches, contract, handoff file | Claude | done |
| 1. Migration 013 + `delivery` module (domain, repo, service) | Claude | **done** (unit-tested; migration **applied to the production DB 2026-10-03**) |
| 2. Delivery routes, rider endpoints, SSE, route tests | Claude | **done** (mounted at `/api/v1/deliveries`; unit-tested, and now **DB-backed integration tested** — see `tests/integration/delivery_flow.test.js`) |
| 2b. DB-backed integration suite (real guard, real DB, real stream) | Claude | **done** (passes against the live database) |
| 2c. Driver assignment: offer expiry, workload-aware rider list, auto-assign | Claude | **done on `feat/delivery-assignment`** (unit-tested, **not merged**, **no DB-backed test yet**; no schema change) |
| 3. Rider page (GPS posting) | ChatGPT/Codex | can start now against `docs/DELIVERY_API.md` v1 — **covered by step 3b's rider hub; check it before starting** |
| 3b. Seller dispatch board, rider hub, riders admin (+ `GET /dispatch`, admin roster) | Claude | **done on `feat/delivery-dispatch-ui`** (unit-tested, reviewed in a dev harness; **not pushed, not merged**, not yet run against the real backend) |
| 3c. Rider presence: go online / offline / pause, heartbeat, dispatch only to riders who are here (migration 017) | Claude | **done on `feat/rider-presence`** (unit-tested, migration checked on PGlite; **not pushed, not merged, migration 017 not applied anywhere**; the admin Riders screen does not show presence yet) |
| 4. Customer tracking screen (map, timeline, code) | ChatGPT/Codex | |
| 5. Merge both, rebuild frontend, end-to-end check | owner | |

## Log
- **Step 3c — Rider presence (Claude, 2026-10-05, branch `feat/rider-presence`, from `main`
  at `450b697`; NOT pushed, NOT merged, migration 017 NOT applied anywhere):** Until now every
  *active* rider was offered every job, whether or not anyone was holding the phone: an offer to
  a closed app sat for the whole 15 minutes. **A rider must now be online.** A rider has a
  presence (`offline | online | busy | paused`, plus a derived `suspended`); they go online,
  offline, pause and resume themselves, the app sends a heartbeat every 30 s, and a rider silent
  for 120 s (`RIDER_PRESENCE_TTL_SECONDS`, 15 to 3600, no "never") is offline. Manual assign,
  auto-assign and `GET /drivers` only consider riders who are online with a fresh beat and not
  carrying an accepted delivery; assigning anyone else is `409 RIDER_UNAVAILABLE` / `RIDER_BUSY`
  with a `details.reason`. Accepting claims the rider atomically (`online -> busy`), so two
  accepts at once cannot both win, and withdraws their other offers; going offline or pausing
  hands unanswered offers back to their sellers (timeline actor `presence`, so it is not a
  decline). The contract, with every rule and error, is `docs/DELIVERY_API.md` v1.3, section
  "Rider presence" (decisions 15 to 23).
  *What exists:* `017_rider_presence.sql` (`iam.rider_presence`, one overwritten row per rider,
  RLS service-role only); `domain/RiderPresence.js`; `application/RiderPresenceService.js`;
  the rider acts, the claim, dispatch eligibility, offer withdrawal, the re-check after an offer
  is written (auto-assign then tries the next ranked rider, up to 5) and roster presence in
  `DeliveryService.js`; the presence methods and the boot probe in `DeliveryRepository.js`; the
  presence sweep in `OfferSweeper.js` (an isolated job: a failing offer-expiry query no longer
  skips the reminders or the presence sweep); six strict routes under `/driver/presence/*` in
  `deliveryRoutes.js` and `deliverySchemas.js`. New fields: `GET /drivers` answers
  `{ drivers, summary: { registered, available } }`, the admin roster rows carry `presence` and
  `lastSeenAt`, `GET /driver/me` carries `presence`. *Client:* `src/services/riderPresence.js`
  (the heartbeat controller), six calls in `deliveryApi.js`, an availability card in
  `riderHub.js`, and a "No rider is online right now" state in `sellerDispatch.js`.
  *Ops:* `scripts/verify_delivery_readiness.js` now fails when `iam.rider_presence` is missing
  (naming 017), warns on an unusable `RIDER_PRESENCE_TTL_SECONDS`, and warns when active riders
  exist but none is online (normal off-hours); `tests/delivery/run.js` runs the seven
  `rider_presence_*` suites.
  *Shared files touched:* `build_redesign.py` (one `<script defer>` for `riderPresence.js`).
  Generated bundles were **not** rebuilt (rule 2): run `npm run build:frontend` after merging.
  No change to `server/index.js`.
  *How to test:* `npm test -- rider_presence` (the new suites), `node tests/helpers/run_suite.js
  tests/unit/rider_presence_service.test.js` (one suite), `npm run test:delivery` (the CI gate:
  every delivery suite, the readiness check, the migrations on a real Postgres engine, the
  client checks). The migration suite needs PGlite (`@electric-sql/pglite`, a devDependency); on a
  machine where it is not installed in the repo, point `NODE_PATH` at a `node_modules` that has
  it, or the suite SKIPS locally (it fails under `CI`). Every suite is hermetic: in-memory
  repository, a fake clock, notifications stubbed. The existing delivery suites were changed
  so that their riders go online first and their world uses a one-hour window, so presence never
  lapses under tests that move the clock for other reasons.
  **WARNING, migration order: apply `017_rider_presence.sql` BEFORE deploying this code**
  (`node scripts/apply_migration.js 017_rider_presence.sql`; `npm run delivery:readiness` checks
  it). Until it is applied, in production, accept, assign, auto-assign, `GET /drivers` and
  every presence route answer `503 DELIVERY_NOT_READY` (a rider's job list and the admin roster still
  load, with presence `null`), and the boot log says
  `[Delivery] NOT READY`. Every rider registered earlier **starts offline** and must open the app
  and go online: tell riders first, or sellers will find nobody to offer a delivery to.
  *Known limits:* the 120 s window and the 30 s beat are starting points, not measured values;
  each online rider adds 2 calls/min to the shared `/api` rate budget (decision 7, not changed);
  accept is atomic in the database, but offer stacking and assignment races across several API
  instances are best effort (the re-check after the offer narrows them; auto-assign's queue is
  per process); ranking reads at most 500 active riders and 1 000 online rows and logs a warning
  at the cap; a delivery ended by a seller or administrator (not the rider) leaves the rider
  online with an old last-seen time, so they read as expired until they go online again; nothing
  has run against a real database with the real session guard, on Railway under load, or on
  real phones.
  **NOT done:** no routing or nearest-rider ranking (the optional position is stored on the
  rider's own row, shown only to them, and not used); no administrator "force offline" (an
  administrator can only suspend, which does force the rider offline); no push or wake-up for
  riders (an offline rider hears nothing: notifications are only read from the feed, which the
  app re-reads every 45 s while open); the admin Riders screen (`ridersAdmin.js`) does not show
  `presence` / `lastSeenAt` yet; no history of when riders were online.
  *Merge notes:* hot spots with the other open delivery branches are the same files as before
  (`DeliveryService.js`, `deliveryRoutes.js`, `deliverySchemas.js`, `DeliveryRepository.js`,
  `OfferSweeper.js`, `delivery_dispatch.test.js`, `delivery_routes.test.js`, `deliveryApi.js`,
  `build_redesign.py`, `DELIVERY_API.md`, this file). Migration numbers: 015 is the
  recommendation events and 016 the open-orders index; 017 is this one.
- **Step 3b — Dispatch screens (Claude, 2026-10-04, branch `feat/delivery-dispatch-ui`,
  from `feat/delivery-frontend-tracking` with `origin/main` merged in; NOT pushed, NOT
  merged):** The screens around assignment that were missing. **Seller**: a dispatch
  board (to dispatch / in progress / completed), an order screen with the delivery's
  state and next action (arrange, choose a rider, auto-assign, change rider, cancel,
  track live), and a rider picker showing each rider's load and who passed. **Rider**:
  an inbox of offers with countdowns, accept and decline, then a job screen per phase
  (pickup, deliver, arrive, 4-digit handover code, report a problem, hand the job
  back) that posts GPS while it is open. This covers step 3's rider page. **Admin**:
  the rider roster, edit, suspend or reactivate, and add a rider by account search or
  ID. Entry points: a Deliveries card on the seller dashboard, a "Deliver with LOUMOO"
  card in the account hub, a "Livreurs" pill in the super-admin tab bar.
  *Backend (contract first, `DELIVERY_API.md` v1.2):* `GET /dispatch` (seller/admin
  board) and `GET /drivers?status=all|active|suspended` (admin roster), in the delivery
  module. **No schema change, no migration.**
  *Shared files touched:* `build_redesign.py` (four `<script defer>` tags after the
  tracking screen's) and `server/modules/commerce/infrastructure/OrderRepository.js`
  (one new read method, `findOrdersBySeller`; existing methods unchanged). Generated
  bundles were built locally to check them, **not committed** (rule 2).
  *Tests:* new `delivery_board` suite; every delivery suite and the client checks
  (`deliveryApi.test.js`, 10/10) pass. The screens were reviewed in light and dark
  mode, on phone and desktop, in `tests/ui/dispatch_harness.html` (mock API; see
  `DELIVERY_FRONTEND.md` → Step 5). **Not run against the real backend or on real
  phones yet.**
  *Merge notes:* this branch carries step 4 (`feat/delivery-frontend-tracking`) too.
  Hot spots: `DeliveryService.js`, `deliveryRoutes.js`, `deliverySchemas.js`,
  `DeliveryRepository.js`, `deliveryApi.js`, `build_redesign.py`, `DELIVERY_API.md`,
  this file. The unmerged `fix/delivery-offer-hardening` (another session) also edits
  `DeliveryService.js` and `delivery_dispatch.test.js`, and adds migration 014.
- **Step 2c — Driver assignment (Claude, 2026-10-03, branch `feat/delivery-assignment`,
  forked from `feat/delivery-backend` at `9a2bbe6`, NOT merged):** Assigning a rider
  and letting them accept already existed (`POST /:id/assign`, `/accept`, `/decline`,
  steps 1–2). What was missing around it, now built: (1) **offer expiry** — an
  `assigned` offer lapses after 15 min (`DELIVERY_OFFER_TTL_MINUTES`, `0` = never),
  returns to `pending_assignment`, notifies seller and rider, and shows
  `offerExpiresAt` to seller/admin/rider (never the buyer); applied lazily when a
  delivery is read or a rider list is ranked, *and* by a once-a-minute sweeper (on a
  serverless runtime there is no sweeper: the seller is only told when something
  touches the delivery or lists riders, see the contract); accepting a lapsed offer
  is always `409 OFFER_EXPIRED`. (2) **`GET /drivers`** now carries
  `openDeliveries` and sorts responsive, then least-busy, riders first; with
  `?deliveryId=` it adds a `declined` boolean per rider. (3) **`POST /:id/auto-assign`**
  picks the first rider in that order who is not the buyer, has not handed this
  delivery back, and does not already hold the offer; `409 NO_RIDER_AVAILABLE` when
  nobody qualifies. A rider who lets an offer lapse sorts behind responsive riders
  for an hour, so one who never answers does not win every offer.
  **No schema change and no migration**: the deadline is `assigned_at + window`, and
  "who handed it back" is read from `delivery_events`. Contract: `docs/DELIVERY_API.md`
  (new section "Offer expiry", decisions 9–10).
  *Shared files touched:* `server/index.js` only — two `require`s next to the
  delivery router and one block in the background-workers section that starts the
  sweeper (and registers its timer for shutdown). Everything else is inside
  `server/modules/delivery/**`, `docs/`, and new test files. **Merge hot spots**
  with `feat/delivery-backend`: `DeliveryService.js`, `deliveryRoutes.js`,
  `deliverySchemas.js`, `DeliveryRepository.js`, `Delivery.js`, `delivery_routes.test.js`,
  `DELIVERY_API.md`, this file.
  *Tests:* new `delivery_dispatch`, `delivery_repository`, `delivery_sweeper` unit
  suites, plus additions to `delivery_domain` and `delivery_routes`. Mutation
  checks: every deliberate break of the production code I tried was caught.
  **One existing integration assertion was edited without being run:**
  `tests/integration/delivery_flow.test.js` (the `GET /drivers` key set now includes
  `openDeliveries`); it needs the live database.
  *Two independent review rounds* (five lenses in all: authz, contract, concurrency,
  operations/DB semantics, adversarial tests; every finding re-checked by a skeptic)
  found, and this branch fixed, in round 1: a huge/tiny `DELIVERY_OFFER_TTL_MINUTES`
  crashing views or disabling expiry (now bounded: 1 s to 1 week); a late accept
  answering 404 once released (now 409); lapsed offers counting as rider workload and
  a non-responding rider winning every offer (lapsed offers are released before
  ranking, and recent lapses sort last); the untested default/env wiring; weak tests;
  and doc overstatements. Round 2 (after those fixes) found, and this branch fixed: a
  failed lazy release turning reads into 500s (now best effort); a seller or admin
  acting as the rider getting 403 instead of 409 on a late accept; auto-assign
  releasing the very delivery it was assigning (spurious 409); concurrent
  auto-assigns all picking one rider (now serialised per process); a failed ranking
  query in production being read as 'nobody is busy' (now an error); a 5000-row cap
  that exceeded the platform's 1000-row limit; a sweep that hammered a failing
  database (now stops at the first infrastructure error) and a 50-offer release
  cap (now bounded rounds); the offer text rounding the window up; and a lost lapse
  timeline row voiding three decisions (now retried once).
  **Known, accepted:** the lapse query filters `delivery_events` on columns with no
  index (migration 013 only indexes `delivery_id`); the table is small today, and
  adding an index is a migration, so it is deferred to whoever owns the database.
  Auto-assign serialisation is per process, not across instances.
  **Decision for the owner (decision 11):** `openDeliveries` shows every seller each
  rider's total workload across all sellers.
  **Not verified:** (a) the two new queries (`findStaleOffers`, `countOpenByDriver`)
  against the real PostgREST/Postgres — the repository suite uses a query-builder
  stand-in, so a DB-backed section in `tests/integration/delivery_flow.test.js` is
  still owed (deliberately not run while the database was in use elsewhere);
  (b) the sweeper on Railway under real load; (c) `GET /drivers` with a large fleet
  (it reads at most 500 active riders and logs a warning if it hits that).
  **Frontend must know:** `offerExpiresAt` is new on every Delivery; a rider's
  `accept` can now answer `409 OFFER_EXPIRED`; the seller's picker should call
  `GET /drivers?deliveryId=…` and grey out `declined: true` riders; there is still
  no seller-facing "assign a rider" screen or rider job-inbox screen in the plan.
- **Step 2b — DB-backed integration suite (Claude, 2026-10-03):** Migration 013
  is now applied to the production Supabase project, and
  `tests/integration/delivery_flow.test.js` drives the whole flow over real HTTP
  against the real database with the real session guard: schema + RLS, rider
  registration (incl. the FK), creation (incl. the one-open-delivery race),
  reads/IDOR, assign, accept (race), the handover-code audience, GPS pings
  (throttle + implausible-jump), pickup→arrive→delivered with the order status
  following in `iam.orders`, the live SSE stream through compression, the 5-wrong-code
  lock + admin unlock/reconcile, failure→retry with a new rider+code, decline,
  buyer/seller cancel, the order→delivery cancel cascade, and rider suspension +
  admin recovery. It **skips with a notice** when 013 is not applied (so `npm test`
  stays usable on a behind DB; set `LOUMOO_REQUIRE_DELIVERY_DB=1` to force failure).
  **Real bug it caught:** migration 013 created the `BIGSERIAL` tables but never
  granted the sequences to `service_role`, so every insert into `delivery_events`
  / `driver_locations` failed with SQLSTATE 42501 — in production (which throws
  instead of the dev in-memory fallback) that would have broken delivery creation.
  Fixed in 013 with explicit table + sequence GRANTs (idempotent). Built as 40+
  small commits. Runs green; cleanup leaves no rows.
- **Step 2 (Claude):** Added `server/modules/delivery/presentation/**` (strict zod
  schemas, `createDeliveryRouter`, 17 routes) and mounted it in `server/index.js`
  (one require + one `v1Router.use`; shared file). `tests/unit/delivery_routes.test.js`
  drives the router over real HTTP with the real error handler and compression
  middleware. **Frontend must know:** (1) the stream needs `Authorization`, so use
  `fetch` streaming, **not** native `EventSource`; (2) on Netlify the stream cannot
  stay open, so poll `GET /:id` every 5-10 s as the fallback; (3) response shapes are
  tabulated in `docs/DELIVERY_API.md` ("Response shapes"); (4) a location ping can
  return `200 {accepted:false, reason}`, which is not an error.
  A second independent review (22 agents, 13 confirmed findings) drove further
  fixes: stream timers leaked when a terminal event raced the snapshot; a GET that
  carried a body hung; stream access was only checked at connect (now re-checked
  against the live account every heartbeat); re-saving a rider without `status`
  reactivated a suspended one; the delivery guards read orders through a never-
  refreshed cache (new `OrderRepository.findOrderByIdFresh`); the stream answers
  `501 STREAM_UNSUPPORTED` on serverless runtimes; open streams are closed on
  shutdown; validation errors are bounded. Mutation checks confirmed the new tests
  fail when each fix is removed.
  *More shared files touched:* `server/index.js` (the mount, plus one line in
  `shutdown()` that closes open streams) and
  `server/modules/commerce/infrastructure/OrderRepository.js` (new
  `findOrderByIdFresh`; `updateFulfillmentStatusAtomic` now compares against the
  database, not a cached copy).
  **Needs a decision (not changed):** the global rate limiter is effectively one
  120/min budget for the whole API behind a single proxy; see decision 7 in
  `docs/DELIVERY_API.md`. **Not verified:** the real session guard + a real
  database (migration 013 unapplied), the stream through a real proxy, and
  behaviour under many concurrent riders.
- **Step 1 (Claude):** Built `013_delivery_tracking.sql` and `server/modules/delivery/**`
  (domain, state machine, derived handover code, repository with in-memory fallback,
  service). Roughly 340 assertions in `tests/unit/delivery_domain.test.js` and
  `tests/unit/delivery_service.test.js` pass. An independent 4-lens adversarial
  review found 18 real issues; all were fixed or documented (e.g. the 5-guess limit could be
  farmed via failed -> re-assign; suspended riders kept working; the 423 lock
  would have surfaced as a 500). **Contract updated to v1: re-read
  `docs/DELIVERY_API.md`.** Notable changes for the frontend: `cancelled` no longer
  cancels the order; riders see only `{area, rounded location}` before accepting;
  `accepted` can be released via `/decline`; new admin endpoints
  (`/drivers/:id`, `/:id/resolve`, `/:id/reconcile`); location pings can answer
  `{accepted:false, reason}`; `GET /drivers` for sellers.
  *Shared files touched (not delivery-owned):*
  `server/modules/commerce/application/OrderLifecycleService.js` (cancelling an order
  now cancels its un-collected delivery) and
  `server/modules/identity/application/DeleteAccountUseCase.js` (scrubs the rider
  record). Both are lazy, best-effort calls. **Untested against a database:** the
  existing account-deletion suites need live Supabase credentials and were not run.
  **Not done:** HTTP routes + SSE (step 2); migration 013 has not been applied.
- **Step 0 (Claude):** Created both branches, wrote the API contract draft and
  this file. Nothing implemented yet. Open decisions are at the bottom of
  `docs/DELIVERY_API.md` — the owner needs to confirm them before step 1.
